A bash function that wraps =cd= to log your directory history.

* Why Does This Exist?
  It is extremely common to need to go back to a directory you've visited
  recently. =mycd= exists to solve this problem in the simplest way possible by
  remembering the last 15 (by default) directories you've visited and providing
  a simple way to list and jump to these directories.

  The directory history is saved across sessions and can be configured to be
  shared between different users.
  
* Installation
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  git clone https://github.com/NicholasBHubbard/mycd
  cp mycd/mycd.bash /etc/profile.d/
  #+END_SRC

  You can of course install =mycd.bash= to any directory you wish.

  Next you will need to source =mycd.bash= from your =.bashrc=. It is also
  recommended that you alias =cd= to =mycd=. Add the following lines to your
  =.bashrc=.
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  if [ -r '/etc/profile.d/mycd.bash' ]; then
      . '/etc/profile.d/mycd.bash'
      alias cd='mycd'
  fi
  #+END_SRC 
  
* Usage
  =mycd= works the same way as regular =cd= except it accepts two special
  arguments.

  The first special argument is =--= which lists your directory history.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  [nick@slacktop ~]$ cd --
     1	/home/nick
     2	/etc/rc.d
     3	/home/nick/Pictures
     4	/
     5	/etc
  #+END_SRC
  The second special argument is =-N= where =N= is one of the numbers listed in
  the =--= output. This changes your directory to the =N=th directory in your
  history.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  [nick@slacktop ~]$ cd -3
  [nick@slacktop Pictures]$ 
  #+END_SRC

* Customization
  There are two variables you can set in your =.bashrc= to modify the behavior
  of =mycd=.

  The first is =MYCD_HIST_LENGTH= which controls the number of history items
  that are remembered. This value defaults to 15. 

  The second variable is =MYCD_HIST_FILE= which controls which file to store the
  directory history in. This value defaults to =$HOME/.mycd-dir-hist=. You can
  use this variable to share directory history between users by setting it to
  the same value in different users =.bashrc='s. Note that if you do this you
  will want to make sure that =MYCD_HIST_LENGTH= is set to the same value for
  each user and the history file is readable and writable by each user.
