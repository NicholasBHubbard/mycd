A bash function that wraps =cd= to log your directory history.

* Why Does This Exist?
  It is extremely common to need to go back to a directory you've visited
  recently. =mycd= exists to solve this problem in the simplest way possible by
  remembering the last 15 (by default) directories you've visited and providing
  a simple way to list and jump to these directories. The directory history is
  saved across sessions, and each user gets their own history.
  
* Installation
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  git clone https://github.com/NicholasBHubbard/mycd
  cp mycd/mycd.bash /etc/profile.d/
  #+END_SRC

  You can of course install =mycd.bash= to any directory you wish.

  Next you will need to source =mycd.bash= from your =.bashrc=. It is also
  recommended that you alias =cd= to =mycd=. Add the following lines to your
  =.bashrc=.
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  if [ -r $DIR/mycd.bash ]; then
     . $DIR/mycd.bash
     alias cd=mycd
  fi
  #+END_SRC 
  
* Usage
  =mycd= works the same way as regular =cd= except it accepts two special
  arguments.

  The first special argument is =--= which lists your directory history.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  [nick@slacktop ~]$ cd --
     1	/home/nick
     2	/etc/rc.d
     3	/home/nick/Pictures
     4	/
     5	/etc
  #+END_SRC
  The second special argument is =-N= where =N= is one of the numbers listed in
  the =--= output. This changes your directory to the =N='th directory in your
  history.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  [nick@slacktop ~]$ cd -3
  [nick@slacktop Pictures]$ 
  #+END_SRC

* Customization
  The =MYCD_HIST_LENGTH= variable can be set to control the number of history
  items that are remembered. This value defaults to 15.
